The value is emitted only when the duration\r\n * Observable emits a value or completes, and if no other value was emitted on\r\n * the source Observable since the duration Observable was spawned. If a new\r\n * value appears before the duration Observable emits, the previous value will\r\n * be dropped and will not be emitted on the output Observable.\r\n *\r\n * Like {@link debounceTime}, this is a rate-limiting operator, and also a\r\n * delay-like operator since output emissions do not necessarily occur at the\r\n * same time as they did on the source Observable.\r\n *\r\n * @example <caption>Emit the most recent click after a burst of clicks</caption>\r\n * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');\r\n * var result = clicks.debounce(() => Rx.Observable.interval(1000));\r\n * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\r\n *\r\n * @see {@link audit}\r\n * @see {@link debounceTime}\r\n * @see {@link delayWhen}\r\n * @see {@link throttle}\r\n *\r\n * @param {function(value: T): SubscribableOrPromise} durationSelector A function\r\n * that receives a value from the source Observable, for computing the timeout\r\n * duration for each source value, returned as an Observable or a Promise.\r\n * @return {Observable} An Observable that delays the emissions of the source\r\n * Observable by the specified duration Observable returned by\r\n * `durationSelector`, and may drop some values if they occur too frequently.\r\n * @method debounce\r\n * @owner Observable\r\n */\n\n\nfunction debounce(durationSelector) {\n  return operators_1.debounce(durationSelector)(this);\n}\n\nexports.debounce = debounce;","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"script"}
