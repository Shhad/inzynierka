Each time it observes one of these emitted inner\r\n * Observables, the output Observable subscribes to the inner Observable and\r\n * begins emitting the items emitted by that. So far, it behaves\r\n * like {@link mergeAll}. However, when a new inner Observable is emitted,\r\n * `switch` unsubscribes from the earlier-emitted inner Observable and\r\n * subscribes to the new inner Observable and begins emitting items from it. It\r\n * continues to behave like this for subsequent inner Observables.\r\n *\r\n * @example <caption>Rerun an interval Observable on every click event</caption>\r\n * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');\r\n * // Each click event is mapped to an Observable that ticks every second\r\n * var higherOrder = clicks.map((ev) => Rx.Observable.interval(1000));\r\n * var switched = higherOrder.switch();\r\n * // The outcome is that `switched` is essentially a timer that restarts\r\n * // on every click. The interval Observables from older clicks do not merge\r\n * // with the current interval Observable.\r\n * switched.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\r\n *\r\n * @see {@link combineAll}\r\n * @see {@link concatAll}\r\n * @see {@link exhaust}\r\n * @see {@link mergeAll}\r\n * @see {@link switchMap}\r\n * @see {@link switchMapTo}\r\n * @see {@link zipAll}\r\n *\r\n * @return {Observable<T>} An Observable that emits the items emitted by the\r\n * Observable most recently emitted by the source Observable.\r\n * @method switch\r\n * @name switch\r\n * @owner Observable\r\n */\n\n\nfunction _switch() {\n  return operators_1.switchAll()(this);\n}\n\nexports._switch = _switch;","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"script"}
