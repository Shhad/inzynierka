As soon as the first source value arrives,\r\n * the timer is enabled by calling the `durationSelector` function with the\r\n * source value, which returns the \"duration\" Observable. When the duration\r\n * Observable emits a value or completes, the timer is disabled, then the most\r\n * recent source value is emitted on the output Observable, and this process\r\n * repeats for the next source value.\r\n *\r\n * @example <caption>Emit clicks at a rate of at most one click per second</caption>\r\n * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');\r\n * var result = clicks.audit(ev => Rx.Observable.interval(1000));\r\n * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\r\n *\r\n * @see {@link auditTime}\r\n * @see {@link debounce}\r\n * @see {@link delayWhen}\r\n * @see {@link sample}\r\n * @see {@link throttle}\r\n *\r\n * @param {function(value: T): SubscribableOrPromise} durationSelector A function\r\n * that receives a value from the source Observable, for computing the silencing\r\n * duration, returned as an Observable or a Promise.\r\n * @return {Observable<T>} An Observable that performs rate-limiting of\r\n * emissions from the source Observable.\r\n * @method audit\r\n * @owner Observable\r\n */\n\n\nfunction audit(durationSelector) {\n  return operators_1.audit(durationSelector)(this);\n}\n\nexports.audit = audit;","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"script"}
